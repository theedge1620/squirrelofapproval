Don't get me wrong, there are an awful lot of advertisements masquerading as legitimate news stories these days.  But this one is way over the top.  To the point that it provides excruciating detail on availability of these delicious morsels.  Edward Bernays would be ashamed of this way too on the nose approach.  But honestly, people are so stupid these days that it really doesn't take intellectual subterfuge to make them climb into their cars en masse in a mad rush for fried food.  True genius would be to release these along with to your door drone delivery, thus doing the maximal public health damage.  Zero stars for ingenuity.  Five for knowing your audience.
