Sometimes multiple propaganda pieces collide, like in this case where the extreme privelege of elite athletes and vaccine over-emphasis collide.  There is absolutely no doubt that favor was given to a total douche that happens to be good at hitting a ball.  Also, that the vaccines have been sold as a silver bullet have turned out to be nothing of the sort.  But to watch the Australian government implode on itself at the crux of these two farces of modern society?  Well, that's just pure fun.  For my part, I'd let any athlete rot in an airport until their muscles atrophy.  But we all know he will eventually be allowed in to play a ridiculous game for millions of dollars.  A game people would be better served to go to the park and play themselves rather than watch overgrown toddlers play it and then throw tantrums in their off-court time.  Or even on the court, considering tennis.  There will always be one rule for the rich, including athletes, and another for the rest of us.  Such is the way of a totally corrupt society that is forced to elevate sports as a distraction, anything to keep focus away from the rot at the core.
