This is just....I almost can't.  Leading personality responsible for climate change omission for decades on daily weather reports, now says people want action and can do it themselves?  Really?  Are you kidding me?  You've been basically lying to us for years on a channel owned by elite profiteers, and now you want to tell us that it's up to us?  I guess water isn't the only thing that runs downhill, after all.  Responsibility does too.  Also extreme precipitation.  Truly.....truly gobsmacking hypocrisy.
