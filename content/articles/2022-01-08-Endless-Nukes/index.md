Fear, glorious FEAR!!!  Clearly, our military industrial complex can't lose a lynch-pin of its constant money sink in the name of "defense."  All of a sudden, when anti-nuclear weapon sentiment increases, you suddenly see the old nuclear spectre resurrected.  This time, in the form of warmongering and fear-flaming over potential wars over Ukraine and/or Taiwan, neither of which the average American cares about.  The never-ending tendency to fan the flames of a long dead cold war never cease to amaze though.
