This story outright confirms that our sham political system is of the rich, by the rich, and for the rich.  The article erroneously singles out one party and state, but a quick perusal of a study by [Open Secrets](https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2020/04/majority-of-lawmakers-millionaires/) shows that regardless of party, our elected officials are decidedly richer than the average citizen they represent.  Of course, they only have their own re-election interests and the interests of their bloated financiers in mind when voting in our stead on any issue.  Still, even though it's a poor attempt at smearing a particular instance, it is remarkable they let this one hit the street.
