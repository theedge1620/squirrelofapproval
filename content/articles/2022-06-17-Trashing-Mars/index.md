This story really has me baffled.  Apparently, some people are worried that our space trash might be messing up the "pristine surface of Mars."  Exactly how many tons of CO2 were emitted to send a rover to survey trash on Mars?  Also, exactly who would care about space trash on Mars?  The only people who might care about this are the Elons of the world, who don't want us to prematurely blight the surface of their next empire.  That's their job, dammit!  But I have to say, sheesh, after they are set up, exactly what are the new Martians going to have time to do, other than clean up the place?  The other odd angle here is the continuous deflection of resources to Mars, inexplicably, when we should focus everything we've got on making the Earth stay habitable.  Yet, because of rich egos, we are again focused on the pipe dream of humanity leaving Earth for some better future, when we all know if some did colonize Mars, the two planets would eventually wipe each other out anyway.  And finally, seriously, if you are seriously worried about pollution on Mars, you need to refocus your concerns and get things into perspective.  Maybe read a book or watch a random non-mainstream documentary for a change.  There are much.....much bigger problems out there that can use your attention.
