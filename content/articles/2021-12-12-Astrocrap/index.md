ONE SMALL STEP FOR PRIVATE CORPORATIONS, ONE GIANT LEAP BACKWARD FOR MANKIND.  This article poorly attempts to re-brand what amounts to a corporate dog and pony show joy ride to the edge of space by the descendant of an actual astronaut as...progress, somehow?  In what world does barely replicating an accomplishment made 60+ years ago count as progress?  If true progress had been made, she would have landed on MARS!!  Just one more instance of private corporations selling long known technology at a markup to morons who don't know any better (yes Tesla fans, the first electric car was built BEFORE the internal combustion engine car).  Seriously, doesn't anyone else find the title of this article hilarious in a very, very sad way?
